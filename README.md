# Super-Anime-Cross-Max
This is an open source game I'm in the middle of working on, which is the evolution of the Anime Cross series on ROBLOX. You are welcome to help out in any way possible! :D

Note: This is more based as an improvement to the first Anime Cross that can't be played anymore, with UI simulating the second game!

Templates for buttons are included, and every version of the official release will only add 1 character, to ensure balance can be kept.
