# Super-Anime-Cross-Max
This is an open source game I'm in the middle of working on, which is the evolution of the Anime Cross series on ROBLOX. You are welcome to help out in any way possible! :D

-- The current Unity build is the 2018.4.f1 series, and I'm really fine with the software being updated to the latest version of it! --

Note: This is more based as an improvement to the first Anime Cross that can't be played anymore, with UI simulating the second game, meaning that the default skill controls (Z,X,C,V), the directional keys, the shift lock feature, and the block button remain as they were from the first.

Templates for buttons and pre-main menu credits are included, and every version of the official release will only add 1 character, to ensure balance can be kept.

The very first character I ever plan to add is Goku, who, funnily enough, will have the option to use his AX1 or AX2 skillsets, like a groove!

Do not forget to leave your title screen card here, so that whoever can code in this project can feature us all! :D
